
Changes in mvmeta 0.2.0
==============================================================================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The arguments 'y' and 'X' has been replaced by 'formula' in mvmeta().
	Now the model is specified through a formula, making easier the 
	inclusion of factors and other variable transformation.

    o	The objects 'class', 'contrasts' and 'model' have been added to mvmeta
	objects, storing info about the fitted model. In particular, method
	functions such as predict() now use model.matrix() and other functions
	to re-build the model.

    o	The function kXlistmk() has been excluded from the package. Now the 
	Kronecker expansion is performed directly in the code. The argument 
	'cen' has been excluded from 'mvmeta().
	
Minor changes
-------------

    o	Changes in dependencies: created a new generic for blup(), in order
	to avoid the loading of metafor and its initial message. Function
	rankMatrix() imported from Matrix to check full-rank of desing matrix.

    o	Documentation changed accordingly.
