Changes in mvmeta 0.2.4 (06 Jan 2011)
===================================

Minor changes
-------------

    o Computation of quantities for Q test moved from qtest to mvmeta.

    o	Q test output now includes also tests for single outcomes.

    o Warning added to mvmeta when convergence not reached.

    o Bug fixed in mvmeta when formula is not specified.

    o beta changed to coef for coherence with other regression functions.

    o Simplified output of predict() and blup(): vector for meta-analysis or
      single prediction. Also label pred changed to fit, coherently with other 
      regression functions.

Changes in mvmeta 0.2.3
========================

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Depends changed to R (>= 2.13.0).


==============================================================================
Changes in mvmeta 0.2.2
========================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The argument 'formula' now accept also matrix-type objects for simple
	meta-analysis.

    o	Included 'fnscale=-1' for optim() and changed the sign of the
	estimation algorithms: now the function maximizes.

    o	Also 'S' and 'mlab' now can be stored in 'data'.

    o	Included labels in the dataframe 'berkey98'.
	
Minor changes
-------------

    o	Documentation changed accordingly.


==============================================================================
Changes in mvmeta 0.2.1
========================

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Fixed bug in printing of qtest.mvmeta().

    o	Documentation changed accordingly.


==============================================================================
Changes in mvmeta 0.2.0
========================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The arguments 'y' and 'X' has been replaced by 'formula' in mvmeta().
	Now the model is specified through a formula, making easier the 
	inclusion of factors and other variable transformation.

    o	The objects 'class', 'contrasts' and 'model' have been added to mvmeta
	objects, storing info about the fitted model. In particular, method
	functions such as predict now use model.matrix() and other functions
	to re-build the model.

    o	The function kXlistmk() has been excluded from the package. Now the 
	Kronecker expansion is performed directly in the code. The argument 
	'cen' has been excluded from 'mvmeta().
	
Minor changes
-------------

    o	Changes in dependencies: created a new generic for blup(), in order
	to avoid the loading of metafor and its initial message. Function
	rankMatrix() imported from Matrix to check full-rank of desing matrix.

    o	Documentation changed accordingly.
